# adventofcode

This repo contains my implementation of the code puzzles located at adventofcode.com

Contained in the root of this folder is shell.nix file.  If you have the [nix package manager installed](https://nixos.org/download/), then you can run `nix-shell` in the root folder and your enviroment will be setup with nodejs so you can run the examples in this folder.
